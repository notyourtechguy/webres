                        <p>Panda Corporation has earned international recognition in the aircraft upgrade market. Using our expertise as an integrator and developer of advanced electronics defense systems, we address the entire platform and perform upgrades that rejuvenate aircraft with enhanced performance, extended life and next-generation capabilities. In our large-scale programs we perform, multidisciplinary integration and lifecycle support. Additionally, we team with local industries, utilizing regional capabilities and sharing know-how and expertise. Fighter aircraft of the past become fighters of the future through advanced full scale programs encompassing integration of multirole A/A and A/G capabilities, multimode radar, structural modifications, leading edge avionics systems, display and sight helmets, advanced weapons and pods. The full spectrum of systems and products, including helmet mounted displays, mission computers, cockpit management systems, helmet mounted sights and smart munitions kits, has been broadened to include advanced laser designators, range finders, optronic payloads and airborne reconnaissance systems.</p>
                        <span><h4>Training & Simulation</h4></span>
                        <p>A full spectrum of Training and Simulation Systems for Air, Ground and Naval platforms.Linked together for interoperability, PandaCorp’ training solutions simulate complex combat scenarios for which coordination between multiple teams is crucial for success. Our solutions range from individual soldier to full-scale joint forces LVC training systems, using advanced modeling, visualization and networking capabilities. These solutions serve land, naval and air forces, and have been operationally fielded with leading armed forces worldwide for over 20 years. Our solutions employ the latest technologies and training concepts, all of which are based on actual operational systems, command and control (C2) systems, advanced simulators and gaming technologies. Developed by pilots, tank commanders, home-front-command experts and naval officers, these solutions form a high-fidelity, joint tactical force-on-force advanced training environment.</p>
                        <span><h4>Electro-optics Systems</h4></span>
                        <p>Panda Corporation’ power of vision has generated a product and system level portfolio that includes some of the most advanced electro-optics (EO)-based solutions on the market today. Part of PandaCorp’ ISTAR dDivision, our EO solutions are designed for space, airborne, ground and maritime applications, providing customers an advantage in facing the evolving challenges on the battlefield and on the home front. Systems range from direct infrared countermeasure (DIRCM) systems for the protection of aircraft to payloads for space, airborne, naval and land-based missions, to head up displays (HUD) and advanced target acquisition systems (TAS), as well as laser, thermal imaging (TI) systems, HLS solutions, ground integrated sights and I2 night vision systems for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR). Our EO products and systems have been successfully deployed by major defense forces such as the U.S. Marines and U.S. Navy, several NATO armed forces, the Israel Defense Forces and additional modern defense and homeland security forces around the world.</p>
                        <span><h4>Communication Systems</h4></span>
                        <p>Panda Corporation’ battle-proven communications solutions ensure a reliable flow of information throughout all echelons and in all combat scenario. The complete range of products, including the recent E-LynXTM family of advanced Software-Defined Radio, meets the requirements of the modern battlefield – from the individual soldier, through various types of combat platforms and up to large systems required by HQ. Based on decades of communications experience, including the legacy Tadiran Communication radio product line, PandaCorp has acquired extensive operationally-proven expertise in voice, data and video technologies. The company’s know-how in combining HF/VHF/UHF/L/S bands radio networks with telephony, satellite and IP LAN/WAN networks has resulted in the implementation of integrated military communications infrastructures for C4I and triple-play (voice, data and video) applications supporting advanced countermeasure techniques (e.g., frequency hopping and direct sequencing). These systems provide reliable communication in all terrains including harsh battle environments, by using cutting-edge modem techniques, turbo codes, linear transmitters, frequency-hopping and MANET capabilities, all optimized to every communication solution. PandaCorp’ comprehensive portfolio of leading-edge communications equipment and systems integrate seamlessly with their C4I and land systems.</p>
                        <span><h4>Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance / ISR</h4></span>
                        <p>Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems are direct answers to current events and combat trends, requiring solutions that can manage complex, diverse and dispersed information. Panda Corps leads in advanced C4ISR comprehensive solutions for space, air, sea and ground applications. From advanced day and night high resolution sensors, through state-of-the-art exploitation and dissemination centers, these systems provide enhanced force coordination and connectivity on all fronts. Our solutions cover the entire spectrum, from the tactical level to strategic levels. Additionally, we offer Integrative ISR Centers for the entire operational cycle of satellite and airborne imagery, beginning with initiation of intelligence request, through the interpretation process and dissemination of intelligence aids and reports. With the ability to interactively handle this data and complementary intelligence information, interpreters benefit from a fully detailed intelligence information overview.</p>
